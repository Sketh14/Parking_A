CAR PARKING
-------------------------------------------------------
- Cars can go backward/forward on the direction they are facing
- Car hits peds | Game Over
- If more than 1 car is on the road, and another car tries to get on the road
    [=] If there is space between the cars, then the car will get on the road between them
    [=] If there is no space, then the car will wait for both of them to pass, and then get on the road
    [=] If 2 cars are side by side, waiting to get on the road, then the car to the right will go first.
        {+} In case, both are trying to get on the road from downwards.
    [=] For 2 cars side-by-side, the car that comes first, going with clockwise direction, will go first
    [=] Show some emoji, when a car hits another car
    [=] Obstacles around the parking area, to blobk the car from moving
    [=] Cars follow point to point while on the road, no need for fancy animation of turning.
        {+} In case of getting on the road also, no turning animation, just quick turn to align with the road
    [=] Need to check for space before the oncoming car, if a car wants to get on the road
    [=] The car rotates from the pivot, no matter where it is hit to shake
        {+} If side, then to and fro
        {+} If frront/back, then that direction
    [=] Keep in mind, how a car turns, if going backwards, then turn to the direction of the road, not 360
    [=] Moved only counts when the vehicle has moved, even if the player has slid the vehicle, if it just
        collides with another vehicle, then it does not count
	[=] A vehicle is divided into smaller 2 parts width wise, maybe same for the length

        {+} Fixing IDLE | MOVING NPCStatus values
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- [DONE] Tumble NPC when hit and goes flying
- [FIXED] [IMP] NPCSpawner | Take corners continously
- [DONE] Make scriptable for vehicles
- [DO] In-game currency
    [=] Powers to utilize in-game currency
    [=] Shrink vehicle to different size vehicle
    [=] Remove vehicle
- [DO] Shop for skins
- [DO] WHeel maybe if possible 
- [DO] [MAYBE IMP] Asss weightage to boundary spawner
    [=] Consistent empty gaps or at least feel like consistent
- [FIX] Increase corner raycasts
    [=] When a vehicle is just behind, then the raycast will not detect a vehicle
- [FIXED] [IMP] If the corner raycasts flag is set and the vehicle has passed the ONBOARDING_ROAD collision check also,
    then, if the 2nd vehicle is coming, it will collide with the current vehicle, as the current vehicle will not further
    check for corner collisions
    [=] Maybe persistent check for corner-collisions
- [FIXED] [IMP] On letting a vehicle to pass from the front, if the second vehicle is not that far behind then the current
    vehile wil collide with the 2nd vehicle and get stuck
    [=] Increasing raycast to down?
    [=] Bottom-Left needs to have raycast flipped
- [FIXED] [IMP] On Corner checks, not all raycasts work
    [=] Fixed, checking hitCount after the loop
- [DO] [IMP] When ONBOARDING_ROAD, it would be possible to keep the raycast at the corner of the roads, as we only need
    to check for the oncoming vehicles, the raycasts for collision checks do not need to move with the vehicle
        {+} This will also somewhat fix the vehicle still moving, even when there is another oncoming vehicle at turn
- [DO] [FIX] ONBOARDING_ROAD collisions check
    [=] If the vehicle is at the corners ans another is approaching from the road, the current vehicle will not be 
        able to detect it with raycast
        {+} Might need to sphere check for edge cases
        {+} Can also keep indexes of moving vehicles and check if any vehicle is besides the current one
- [DO] [FIX] When ONBOARDING_ROAD, the vehicle moves even when getting a tiny gap
    [=] There is a delay between onboaridng the road and getting no collisions
        {+} Within the delay, another passing vehicle can come and collide with the current vehicle
        {+} But it is too late, and the vehicle is already onboarding the road
- [Do] [IMP] Might need another heck while pulling onto the road, to check whether there are any cars just about to pass
    [=] Sometimes the collision check does not work for vehicles just about to cross but 
        the vehicle has crossed the On-Road threshold
    [=] Take some offset from the road boundaries and if crossed then use WaitForVehicle collision check to check 
        for passing vehicles
    [=] Use different layermask and enable the check as soon as it touches the last cell
- [Do] [IMP] Fill the vehicle grid with bounary values and check collisions while placement
- [DO] [IMP] Boundary Checks
- [DO] [IMP] Collision Checks
    [=] When vehicle is moving
        {+} Check if collided wth another vehicle  [DONE FOR NOW]
        {+} Check if there is another vehicle on the road, before entering the road
    [=] What happens when the vehicle collides?
        {+} Reset the collision check
        {+} Do something to the collider and the one colliding
            <~> Shake the colliding vehicle
    [=] 2 conditions can give to collisions
        {+} When a vehicle is moving towards another vehicle  [DONE FOR NOW]
        {+} When a vehicle is moving into the road and another vehicle is in front
- Need to check in lower cells also, as the vehicles are 2 cells wide
- [DO] [DONE FOR NOW] Divide into smaller sections
    [=] Move every 0.05 intervals
    [=] For Small Vehicle | Center will always be multiple of 0.5
    [=] For Medium Vehicle | Center will always in interval of 0.5 starting from the (-0.75 | 0.75)
    [=] For Large Vehicle | Center will always in interval of 0.5 starting from the (-1 | 1)
    [=] Since every Vehicle has the same width and only the length differs
        {+} Need to only change the length value, breadth value can remain the same
- [DO] Vehicle Collision Detection
    [=] Make sectors and add vehicles, for less load [DONE FOR NOW]
    [=] [IMP] Detect collisions while getting on road
- [DO] [DONE FOR NOW] Pooling System 
- [DO] [DONE FOR NOW] Vehicle Placement around the parking lot
    [=] Can make a random placement logic, just checking if the car algined has a way to get out in any direction
- [Do] Vehicle shake
    [=] After collision, shake the vehicle
- [Do]  [DONE FOR NOW] Vehicle Collision Detection
    [=] Raycast front and back from sides?
        {+} Poking a little on the front and back to detect other vehicles
- [DO] [DONE FOR NOW]Vehicles can lerp to rotate towards the next marker, so that the rotation fo vehicle does not goes wrong
    [=] Simply rotating the vehicle

- To check if the vehicles have reached the road or not?
    [=] Can use trigger | Would have to attach rigidbody to vehicles | would be unnecessary
    [=] Can just use co-ordinates, as the scene is not changing

- Limit Values
    [=] Taking Absolute values as the direction would not matter
        {+} The vehicle can go forward/backward
    [=] Threshold : 0.75 for both

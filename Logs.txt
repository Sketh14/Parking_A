CAR PARKING
-------------------------------------------------------
- Cars can go backward/forward on the direction they are facing
- Car hits peds | Game Over
- If more than 1 car is on the road, and another car tries to get on the road
    [=] If there is space between the cars, then the car will get on the road between them
    [=] If there is no space, then the car will wait for both of them to pass, and then get on the road
    [=] If 2 cars are side by side, waiting to get on the road, then the car to the right will go first.
        {+} In case, both are trying to get on the road from downwards.
    [=] For 2 cars side-by-side, the car that comes first, going with clockwise direction, will go first
    [=] Show some emoji, when a car hits another car
    [=] Obstacles around the parking area, to blobk the car from moving
    [=] Cars follow point to point while on the road, no need for fancy animation of turning.
        {+} In case of getting on the road also, no turning animation, just quick turn to align with the road
    [=] Need to check for space before the oncoming car, if a car wants to get on the road
    [=] The car rotates from the pivot, no matter where it is hit to shake
        {+} If side, then to and fro
        {+} If frront/back, then that direction
    [=] Keep in mind, how a car turns, if going backwards, then turn to the direction of the road, not 360
    [=] Moved only counts when the vehicle has moved, even if the player has slid the vehicle, if it just
        collides with another vehicle, then it does not count
	[=] A vehicle is divided into smaller 2 parts width wise, maybe same for the length

- [DO] [DONE MAYBE] If 2/3 vehicles try to exit side-by-side, they will stuck
    [=] Happens more in the middle-left section if the small vehicle is midway of leaving 
        and 2 medium vehicles are on the sides just behind it
- [DO] Someway combine adjacent and boundary check
    [=] This will help improve the spawn count of vehicles
    [=] Right now, the vehicles which are adjacent are lost even with a valid boundary
- [DO] [IMP] [DONE] Add Bounds Check to Adjacent Vehicles Check
- [DO] Reduce MoveVehicle() in VehicleController
    [=] Move the common parts together
- [FIX] [FIXED] When ONBOARDING_ROAD, Vehicle can get stuck
    [=] Raycast detects oncoming vehicle and current vehicle gets stuck in the middle of ONBOARDING_ROAD,
        despite having enough space to Onboard
- [FIX] [FIXED!] Vehicle Placment Validation | Random Seed - "20173054"
    [=] Opposing vehicles can block each other by 1 block
        <~> Ex: Vehicle[2]I[019]O[1]_0000 | Vehicle[2]I[021]O[0]_0000 | Vehicle[3]I[020]O[1]_0000 block each other by 1 block horizontally
        <~> [FIXED SOMEWHAT] Position validation is done, but spawning is way less now
- [FIX] [FIXED] Next Level Generation

- [FIX] [FIXED] NPC not following route now | Random Seed - "1316642"
- [FIX] [FIXED For NOW] ONBOARDING_ROAD check fail | Car boards the road and stops | bottom-right | Random Seed - "1316642"
- [FIX] [IMP] Boundary Validation is wrong
- [DO] Maybe follow the routine of setting flag for resetting level
    [=] Request Made, Values Changed, Continue With Gameplay

    [=] Consistent empty gaps or at least feel like consistent
- [FIX [DONE]] Increase corner raycasts
    [=] When a vehicle is just behind, then the raycast will not detect a vehicle
- [FIXED] [IMP] If the corner raycasts flag is set and the vehicle has passed the ONBOARDING_ROAD collision check also,
    then, if the 2nd vehicle is coming, it will collide with the current vehicle, as the current vehicle will not further
    check for corner collisions
    [=] Maybe persistent check for corner-collisions
- [FIXED] [IMP] On letting a vehicle to pass from the front, if the second vehicle is not that far behind then the current
    vehile wil collide with the 2nd vehicle and get stuck
    [=] Increasing raycast to down?
    [=] Bottom-Left needs to have raycast flipped
- [FIXED] [IMP] [DONE] On Corner checks, not all raycasts work
    [=] Fixed, checking hitCount after the loop
- [DO] [IMP] [DONE] When ONBOARDING_ROAD, it would be possible to keep the raycast at the corner of the roads, as we only need
    to check for the oncoming vehicles, the raycasts for collision checks do not need to move with the vehicle
        {+} This will also somewhat fix the vehicle still moving, even when there is another oncoming vehicle at turn
- [DO] [FIX] [DONE] ONBOARDING_ROAD collisions check
    [=] If the vehicle is at the corners ans another is approaching from the road, the current vehicle will not be 
        able to detect it with raycast
        {+} Might need to sphere check for edge cases
        {+} Can also keep indexes of moving vehicles and check if any vehicle is besides the current one
- [DO] [FIX] [DONE] When ONBOARDING_ROAD, the vehicle moves even when getting a tiny gap
    [=] There is a delay between onboaridng the road and getting no collisions
        {+} Within the delay, another passing vehicle can come and collide with the current vehicle
        {+} But it is too late, and the vehicle is already onboarding the road
- [Do] [IMP] [DONE] Might need another heck while pulling onto the road, to check whether there are any cars just about to pass
    [=] Sometimes the collision check does not work for vehicles just about to cross but 
        the vehicle has crossed the On-Road threshold
    [=] Take some offset from the road boundaries and if crossed then use WaitForVehicle collision check to check 
        for passing vehicles
    [=] Use different layermask and enable the check as soon as it touches the last cell
- [Do] [IMP] [DONE] Fill the vehicle grid with bounary values and check collisions while placement

        {+} When a vehicle is moving into the road and another vehicle is in front
- Need to check in lower cells also, as the vehicles are 2 cells wide
- [DO] [DONE FOR NOW] Divide into smaller sections
    [=] Move every 0.05 intervals
    [=] For Small Vehicle | Center will always be multiple of 0.5
    [=] For Medium Vehicle | Center will always in interval of 0.5 starting from the (-0.75 | 0.75)
    [=] For Large Vehicle | Center will always in interval of 0.5 starting from the (-1 | 1)
    [=] Since every Vehicle has the same width and only the length differs
        {+} Need to only change the length value, breadth value can remain the same

    [=] Simply rotating the vehicle

- To check if the vehicles have reached the road or not?
    [=] Can use trigger | Would have to attach rigidbody to vehicles | would be unnecessary
    [=] Can just use co-ordinates, as the scene is not changing

- Limit Values
    [=] Taking Absolute values as the direction would not matter
        {+} The vehicle can go forward/backward

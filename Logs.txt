CAR PARKING
-------------------------------------------------------
- Cars can go backward/forward on the direction they are facing
- Car hits peds | Game Over
- If more than 1 car is on the road, and another car tries to get on the road
    [=] If there is space between the cars, then the car will get on the road between them
    [=] If there is no space, then the car will wait for both of them to pass, and then get on the road
    [=] If 2 cars are side by side, waiting to get on the road, then the car to the right will go first.
        {+} In case, both are trying to get on the road from downwards.
    [=] For 2 cars side-by-side, the car that comes first, going with clockwise direction, will go first
    [=] Show some emoji, when a car hits another car
    [=] Obstacles around the parking area, to blobk the car from moving
    [=] Cars follow point to point while on the road, no need for fancy animation of turning.
        {+} In case of getting on the road also, no turning animation, just quick turn to align with the road
    [=] Need to check for space before the oncoming car, if a car wants to get on the road
    [=] The car rotates from the pivot, no matter where it is hit to shake
        {+} If side, then to and fro
        {+} If frront/back, then that direction
    [=] Keep in mind, how a car turns, if going backwards, then turn to the direction of the road, not 360
